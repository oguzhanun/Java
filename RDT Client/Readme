In this programming assignment, you will program a client which communicates with a server
reliably. Your client program will use UDP at the transport layer and ensure reliability at the application
layer. Your client must be a console application (no graphical user interface, GUI, is required) and should
be named as RDTClient (i.e., the name of the class that includes the main method should be RDTClient).
The server code will be provided with the assignment.
Reliable Communication
Your client program will send data to and receive data from the provided server. Since you will
most probably test your client code on a single machine, i.e., your own, the server we provide will
simulate loss through the random dropping of messages. The server will drop the following message
with some probability:
• Your client’s outgoing data message
• Your client’s outgoing acknowledgment message
• The server’s outgoing data message
• The server’s outgoing acknowledgment message
